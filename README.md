Iris Flower Classification:
This project demonstrates Machine Learning classification on the famous Iris dataset.
It predicts the species of Iris flower (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) using sepal and petal measurements.

Features:
1. Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset
2. Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Trained a Logistic Regression model
4. Evaluated performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
5. Saved and reloaded the trained model for predictions

Project Structure:
1. Notebook/Script – Main code for training and evaluation
2. Saved Model – Trained Logistic Regression model (iris_model.pkl)
3. Label Encoder – Encoder for species labels (label_encoder.pkl)
4. Requirements File – List of required libraries


Results:
1. Achieved around 97% accuracy
2. Strong classification performance across all three species
3. Visualized data distribution, feature relationships, and confusion matrix

Tech Stack:
1. Python
2. Pandas, NumPy
3. Matplotlib, Seaborn
4. Scikit-learn
5. Joblib

Future Work
1. Experiment with other ML models (Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM)
2. Deploy as an interactive web app using Streamlit or Flask
3. Host on platforms like Heroku or Hugging Face Spaces
