🌸 Iris Flower Classification
This project demonstrates Machine Learning classification on the famous Iris dataset.
It predicts the species of Iris flower (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) using sepal and petal measurements.

📌 Features
Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset
Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Trained a Logistic Regression model
Evaluated performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
Saved and reloaded the trained model for predictions

📂 Project Structure
Notebook/Script – Main code for training and evaluation
Saved Model – Trained Logistic Regression model (iris_model.pkl)
Label Encoder – Encoder for species labels (label_encoder.pkl)
Requirements File – List of required libraries
README – Project documentation

📊 Results
Achieved around 97% accuracy
Strong classification performance across all three species
Visualized data distribution, feature relationships, and confusion matrix

🛠 Tech Stack
Python
Pandas, NumPy
Matplotlib, Seaborn
Scikit-learn
Joblib

🚀 Future Work
Experiment with other ML models (Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM)
Deploy as an interactive web app using Streamlit or Flask
Host on platforms like Heroku or Hugging Face Spaces
